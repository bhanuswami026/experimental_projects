### ABOUT THE REPOSITORY: WHY WAS THIS CREATED?
This repository contains all the projects with small diverse datasets on which one can experiment the ideas of machine learning and deep learning. 

### HOW TO MAKE BEST USE OF THIS REPOSITORY?
The life of machine and deep learning practioner is that of life long learning. 
As the new theoretical knowledge is acquired by the practioner, say techniques of feature selection, these experimental datasets can be used to code the theory to action.


This repository is a work in progress.
